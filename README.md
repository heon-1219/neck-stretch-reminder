# neck-stretch-reminder
My neck hurts because of prolonged screen time. Doc said I'll get better if I stretch every 20 mins or so during screen time. So, I created a reminder for myself. I hope my neck gets better. 

# How to use
Every 20 mins, you will be reminded to stretch your neck for 20 seconds. A notification will pop up to remind you. If you click the notification, you can make it go away instantly. Also, you can disable / turn on the reminder through the initial reminder. No need to start the reminder initially, as it activates automatically on the first run.
